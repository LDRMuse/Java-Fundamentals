Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

We have an object called "c" that is of type Parent, but we are calling the Child's overwritten method.
The Child class has an overwritten method (even though it doesn't have that annotated as @Override) and it calls the Child class doSomething()
Therefore printing "Child called" will be printed.

public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
